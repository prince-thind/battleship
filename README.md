# Battleship

Popular battleship game's web version built using vanilla JS with webpack for bundling and deployment. This project is not meant to be perfect but rather a learning experience for anyone to realize the potential of JS as it did to me. The project is ofcourse far from perfect and I can already feel the temptation to refactor the entire code database haha!
